## pwnkit (CVE-2021-4034) Privilege Escalation exploit sample

This repository contains an exploit of CVE-2021-4034, a local
privilege escalation in `pkexec`. This implementation is based on that
described in the [CVE
disclosure](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=164313339424946&w=2), which you should read.

If this works on your machine, it means you are vulnerable. To address
this, either update polkit to a patched version, or disable the `setuid`
bit on `pkexec` with the following:

```
$ sudo chmod a-s $(which pkexec)
```

This exploit is dangerously easy to write based on the information in
the disclosure, so patch all of your machines ASAP.
